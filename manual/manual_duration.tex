\label{sec:IllumCorrectionDuration}
Important for such a correction is the duration, especially for testing different magnitude cuts. The script needs about 10 minutes for a single average run to filter, plot, fit and create the correction images per band. The time to correct the images is very sensitive to the number of images and the speed of the used hard drive. Tests showed that the average time with 32 parallel processes on a raid is about one image per second per process. For a representative run, 1632 files (51 images with 32 chips each) have to be corrected, resulting in a duration of about a minute. In total, the illumination correction needs less than 15 minutes to correct an entire run (for one band) from the beginning until the end. If the correction mode is changed from run based to night based, the first part scales linearly while the second part stays constant.
